# AG-Mono:A Monocular Dataset for Unmanned Air Vehicles
This dataset was created at three different exposure times using a handheld platform, and it includes video sequences at 640x480 image resolution. 
The experimental area where the images were created is a closed corridor with 16.5 x 4.5 meters and four sharp corners.
